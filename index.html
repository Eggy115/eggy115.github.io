                        <p>Hello! Welcome to my website. I do not know what this is for really. I used to have an awful lot of social media, but I decided that was bad for my health and privacy and other such things. However, I still like making content, helping people, and computers, so I think this is my compromise.</p>
                        <p>I'll just host my videos here (instead of YouTube), post my pictures here (instead of Instagram), and talk about my political thoughts <italics>here</italics> instead of... I have no clue, honestly.</p>
                        <p>This website is a mess.</p>

                <p>Source code for the website and any tools or resources included in other areas of the website. I decided that I was going to have as little Javascript as possible on this site, so actually it's mostly just the website's HTML on github.</p></a>
